### MVP/PostMVP
  
#### MVP 


- create and use external API from AirTable.com
- Use react for DOM manipulation
- Allow users to contribute words in any of the different languages the app will have, (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian) and or an image to represent the verb.
- Allow the user to see and read each individual verb in a specific route.
-Implement Grid and/or Flex to style the application.


#### PostMVP  


- Add a second API with the country's name and their native language.
- Allow the users to see the page in two different colors.
- Provide links for users to find online language classes.
